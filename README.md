This repository contains an educational implementation of AES-128 (encryption only) written in Intel 8086 assembly (MASM / TASM compatible). The implementation performs the AES core functions — SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey and the key schedule — adapted and optimized to fit the 16-bit register/memory model of the 8086. The code was developed and tested under DOS/emulator environments (DOSBox / emu8086).
